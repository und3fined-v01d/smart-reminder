# smart-reminder

The typical task-reminder apps are majorly based around the idea wherein we set time-stamps in the app to remind us to do a particular task. However in most circumstances, it may be beneficial to set reminders based on a place. As a concrete example, consider a reminder set for purchasing newspaper on your way home from an early morning walk. On weekends when one typically tends to get up late, it would be very annoying to see this reminder buzz early in the morning.
In these circumstances, this app comes in handy where in the reminder is set based on a location and an estimate of the time window in which you'd be near the specified location.

Since the location data is stored locally on the users phone and not sent to any remote server, the fear of violating ones privacy is eliminated and so location tracking is being implemented on an external server.
